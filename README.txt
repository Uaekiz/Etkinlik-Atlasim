While making the website;

The project was developed using a user-centered design approach. We began by gathering insights through informal observations and short surveys to understand user needs. Based on this, we designed a simple, structured, and consistent interface that is easy to navigate and accessible to all users.

We created a conceptual structure where each event category (theater, concert, tour) had its own page, and the homepage served as the main navigation hub. Design decisions were guided by key UI principles—simplicity, structure, consistency, and tolerance.

We also considered the human-action cycle, ensuring users could plan, act, and receive clear feedback during interactions. Interaction elements like buttons and forms were designed for clarity and ease of use, and form validation was added to help users avoid and recover from mistakes.

We conducted several internal tests and also asked a few users to try the site. Based on the feedback we received, there were no issues such as dead links or malfunctioning features. A short waiting period was added after the application process, both for system optimization and to create a more natural user experience. Content integrity was maintained up to Mobile L size, thanks to Bootstrap and custom @media rules.
